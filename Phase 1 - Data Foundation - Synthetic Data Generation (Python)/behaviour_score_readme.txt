The behavior_score Calculation: A Step-by-Step Breakdown
This is the code block that performs the calculation:
code
Python
ml_df['behavior_score'] = (
    ml_df['income_consistency_score'] * weights['income_consistency_weight'] +
    ml_df['avg_monthly_food'] * weights['food_spending_weight'] +
    ml_df['avg_monthly_ott'] * weights['ott_spending_weight'] +
    ml_df['loan_repayment_consistency'] * weights['loan_repayment_consistency_weight'] +
    ml_df['bnpl_repayment_consistency'] * weights['bnpl_repayment_consistency_weight'] +
    ml_df['debt_burden_ratio'] * weights['debt_burden_risk_weight'] +
    ml_df['had_menstrual_leave_pattern'] * weights['menstrual_leave_pattern_weight']
)
Here is what each term means for a single user:
income_consistency_score * weights['income_consistency_weight']
Feature: A score from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfectly stable income.
Weight: 1.5 (a positive number).
Impact: A user with a perfect score of 1 gets a +1.5 boost to their final score. This is a positive contribution for good behavior.
loan_repayment_consistency * weights['loan_repayment_consistency_weight']
Feature: A score from 0 to 1 representing the percentage of months they paid their EMI.
Weight: 2.0 (a large positive number).
Impact: A user who never misses an EMI payment gets a +2.0 boost. This is highly rewarded.
bnpl_repayment_consistency * weights['bnpl_repayment_consistency_weight']
Feature: Same as above, but for BNPL.
Weight: 1.5 (a positive number).
Impact: Consistent BNPL payments are also rewarded, giving a +1.5 boost.
debt_burden_ratio * weights['debt_burden_risk_weight']
Feature: The user's total debits divided by their total income. A high value (e.g., 0.9) means they spend almost everything they earn.
Weight: -2.5 (a large negative number).
Impact: This is a risk penalty. If a user has a high debt burden of 0.9, this term becomes 0.9 * -2.5 = -2.25. It significantly drags down their final score.
had_menstrual_leave_pattern * weights['menstrual_leave_pattern_weight']
Feature: A simple flag, either 1 (if they have the pattern) or 0 (if they don't).
Weight: -0.2 (a small negative number).
Impact: This applies a small, consistent penalty of -0.2 only to the 10% of female users who exhibit this specific spending behavior, allowing you to test if it's a weak signal of risk.
avg_monthly_food & avg_monthly_ott
These are included to add more dimensions, but with smaller weights (0.8 and 0.5). They contribute to the score but have less impact than the major factors like debt and repayment consistency.
Putting It All Together: The Final Sum
After calculating all these individual (feature * weight) products, the script sums them all up to create the final behavior_score for each user.
A user with high income consistency and perfect repayment records will have a high positive score. A user with a high debt burden and missed payments will have a low or even negative score.
This single, powerful number summarizes a huge amount of complex financial behavior, making it an incredibly valuable feature for any machine learning model that comes next.
